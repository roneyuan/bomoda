Bomoda Python and NodeJS Exercises

Exercise 1:

My idea - 

Create a JSON file (info.json) 
-> Load info.json everytime the application is executed 
-> Read the data 
-> if it is first time running, update "FirstCalledDateTime" 
-> Load every value from JSON file 
-> Calculate processing time, current calls, and lifetime calls 
-> Return a new JSON response 
-> When the application quit, reset "LifetimeTotalCalls" and "CurrentProcessStartTime"
